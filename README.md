# Nodal Analysis 

  The algorithm uses linear algebra methods to elaborate the 
	nodal analysis method, called node-voltage analysis, to
	determine the potential difference between the nodes in an
	electrical circuit.

	The nodal analysis metod used in this program uses the hypothesis
	of current controlled sides of the electrical circuit.

	Another hypothesis is that the electric circuit is linear and it is
	built by single bipolar elements.

	It is applied on a circuit of 3 nodes.
